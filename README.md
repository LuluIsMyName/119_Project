# 119_Project current objectives
- just need to add shape size boxes to all shapes (not just square)
- box to show pen size
- box to show brush color

Josh's idea:
- we can layer a giant invisible turtle over the screen then clicking on the screen would return the big turtles cords and then we can have either the same big turtle draw or init some other smaller turtle to draw.
