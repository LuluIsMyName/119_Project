# 119_Project current objectives

- create box that shows brush color
- create box that shows brush size
- make a way to adjust shape sizes

Josh's idea:
- we can layer a giant invisible turtle over the screen then clicking on the screen would return the big turtles cords and then we can have either the same big turtle draw or init some other smaller turtle to draw.

Extras: 
- create box that can undo
