# 119_Project current objectives

- create a box that will display size of preset shapes
- create box that shows brush color
- create box that shows brush size
- copy the same type of code so other 3 shape boxes are functional


Josh's idea:
- we can layer a giant invisible turtle over the screen then clicking on the screen would return the big turtles cords and then we can have either the same big turtle draw or init some other smaller turtle to draw.

Extras: 
- create box that can undo
- create box that can clear canvas and then run init() again and also clear variables(or keep them)
